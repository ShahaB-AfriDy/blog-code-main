# blog-code-main

This repository contains the source code and resources used for creating and managing blog projects. It is designed to help developers, writers, and educators organize reusable code used in articles, tutorials, and technical blogs.

## Overview

The **blog-code-main** project provides a clean and well-structured base for writing, testing, and sharing code used in educational or technical blogging. It ensures a simple setup with secure handling of environment variables and exclusion of unnecessary files from version control.

## Features

* Organized source code for blog-related projects
* Environment variable support using `.env`
* `.gitignore` configured to exclude image and temporary files
* Easy to customize and extend for different blog topics
* Suitable for both educational and technical blog tutorials

## Usage

You can freely modify and extend the code examples according to your blog requirements.
Make sure to use your **own API keys** or credentials inside the `.env` file if your scripts depend on external services.

```python
# Example: Load environment variables
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

api_key = os.getenv("API_KEY")

print("Blog code environment loaded successfully.")
```
